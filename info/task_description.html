    When New Year is coming everybody waits the visit of Santa Claus.
    He comes with a huge bag of gifts, and you can take any.
    But how to make the best choose - so Santa gets them out of the bag one at a time,
    and if you don't like it - puts it again to bag forever.
    What a disappointment, when the last thing from the bag is a doll,
    and you have already refused to pirate hat because hoping to get a saber!
</p>
<p>
    When this happened with John, Dad told him - "Don't worry,
    I teach you how to choose a better gift. Did you knew how much gifts in the bag?"
</p>

<p>
    You are given a number of gifts in a bag.
    The "bag" is a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator</a> with floats --
    prices for the gifts.
    You can iterate this generator but only once and while you iterate the "bag" you can
    accept a current gift by calling "accept_gift" function which is given as the third argument.

</p>

<p>
    Your function will be checked many times with different bags which have various sizes from 10 to 1000 gifts.
    We count only the best gifts from each bag -- the second place gifts are not for us.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Input: </strong> Three arguments.<br>
    <em>total_gifts</em> - a number of gifts in a bag as an integer.<br>
    <em>bag</em> - a generator that returns a float values of gifts.<br>
    <em>accept_gift</em> - the callback function which you should call to accept gift.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Output: </strong> It does not matter.
